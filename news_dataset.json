Onaka, who had certified both released birthAnother fact that refutes this specific claim is that the law allowing foreign-born children to obtain Hawaiian birth certificates did not exist until 20 years after Obama was born, while Obama\\'s published birth certificate says his birth information was recorded four days after his birth in 1961, and explicitly states that he was born in Honolulu.[104]In April of that year, some supporters of Hillary Clinton circulated anonymous chain emails repeating the same rumor;[42] among them was an Iowa campaign volunteer, who was fired when the story emerged.[43][44] These and numerous other chain e-mails during the subsequent presidential election circulated false rumors about Obama\\'s origin, religion, and birth certificate.[45][46] On June 9, 2008, Jim Geraghty of the conservative website National Review Online suggested that Obama release his birth certificate.[47][48] Geraghty wrote that releasing his birth certificate could debunk several false rumors circulating on the Internet, namely: that his middle name was originally Muhammad rather than Hussein; that his mother had originally named him \"Barry\" rather than \"Barack\"; and that Barack Obama Sr. was not his biological father, as well as the rumor that Barack Obama was not a natural-born citizen.[48][49][50]In September 2012, the State Objections Board of Kansas, composed of \"three of the state\\'s top elected Republicans\", delayed acting on a petition to remove Barack Obama\\'s name from the ballot, requesting information from Hawaii regarding his birth certificate;[265] however, they later voted unanimously to accept Obama\\'s citizenship and retain him on the state\\'s ballot, despite objections from the floor by Orly Taitz.[266] White House responses A common claim among those arguing that President Obama was not born in Hawaii is that all doubt would be settled if Obama released his \"long form\" birth certificate.|'] [\"|Listen Share by Michael Davies Washington, DC  A former Secret Service agent whose new book is quickly climbing Amazons best-seller charts, said he is concerned about the state of the country and says it is time the public knows the real truth about our Commander in Chief, Barack Obama.Secret Service Agent Says Obama Is Muslim & Gay In New Tell-All Book John Chalekson's Network  Follow 3 min read  Dec 18, 2016 --|\"] ['|A former Secret Service agent whose new book is quickly climbing Amazons best-seller charts, said he is concerned about the state of the country and says it is time the public knows the real truth about our Commander in Chief, Barack Obama.Former agent, Paul Horner, in his new tell-all book The Black House, reveals what goes on inside the White House when the news cameras are turned off.|'] ['|If you try to verify your account with a fake picture or someone else picture, or just spam me with fake pictures, you will get Banned!The picture has to contain you and forum name on piece of paper or on your body and your username or my username instead of the website name, if you prefer that.|'] ['|But it is certainly true that even as the white male vote as a percentage of the electorate has declined precipitously, the Republican proportion of that vote has steadily grown, from the upper fortieth percentile for Dewey in 1948 to the upper fiftieth percentile for Eisenhower to a consistent sixtieth percentile since 1980.Google Obama gay rumors and you gethold on!15.5 million hits, most of them crackpots like conspiracy theorist Jerome Corsi, one of the original Swift Boaters, who interviewed a man who knew Obama at Occidental and described the future presidents relationship with his roommate as a close, intimate emotional attachment, even though the only evidence for that attachment was the fact that I saw them standing very close to one another.|'] ['|A former Secret Service agent whose new book is quickly climbing Amazons best-seller charts, said he is concerned about the state of the country and says it is time the public knows the real truth about our Commander in Chief, Barack Obama.Former agent, Paul Horner, in his new tell-all book The Black House, reveals what goes on inside the White House when the news cameras are turned off.|']"

contractors on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.[165]On vetoing the bill, he stated that the pipeline played an \"overinflated role\" in US political discourse and would have had relatively little impact on job creation or climate change.[199] Drug policy and criminal justice reform The Obama administration took a few steps to reform the criminal justice system at a time when many in both parties felt that the US had gone too far in incarcerating drug offenders,[202] and Obama was the first president since the 1960s to preside over a reduction in the federal prison

it abandoned a close US ally.[336] Trade agreements The Obama administration maintained existing trade agreements and concluded new ones with Panama, Colombia, and South Korea Like his predecessor, Obama pursued free trade agreements, in part due to the lack of progress at the Doha negotiations in lowering trade barriers worldwide.[337]Though many Republicans did not like the deal, the bill

scientists but among the communities that have emerged over the past 20 years of parents and professionals caring for autistic children.35 Specifically, parents and clinicians who have framed autism in biomedical terms (such as immune or gastrointestinal dysfunction) have been critical agents in promoting both the concept of the autism epidemic and the primacy of vaccines as its cause.|'] ['|Lacking the scientific background, in an attempt to protect their children, parents contemplating the risk of vaccine are vulnerable to omission biases by which they are more likely to take the risk of inaction than the risk of action.12 Efforts to break the link between autism and MMR vaccine by professional health care provider organizationsby employing compassionate and nonconfrontational educational meanswere mostly unsuccessful, and surveys are being conducted to understand the reasons and find remedies.13 On the contrary, for parents who are inclined to reject the vaccine, well-supported scientific explanations about the safety of vaccines tend to reinforce their conviction.14As with the mumps virus, no plausible argument or scientific evidence to the contrary could persuade the anti-mercury crusaders.7 That no parallels could be drawn between repeated ingestion of large amounts of mercury-infested food and the exposure to minimal and controlled amounts of mercury in the vaccine, or the fact that after thimerosal had been eliminated from the MMR vaccine, the incidence of autism increased rather than decreased, did not resonate with the convinced.|'] ['|Unlike subunit vaccines, the array of S protein on the VLP surface crosslinks the B cell receptor and directly activates B cells, but, like subunit and inactivated viral vaccines, VLPs also typically require an adjuvant and repeated administration137.Protein subunit vaccines Currently, there are seven COVID-19 subunit vaccines in clinical trials (Table 2), with 50 other candidates under preclinical development, making this the most common platform5.Table 2 COVID-19 vaccine candidates in or entering clinical trials Full size table Box 3 Animal models of COVID-19 for vaccine testing There is an urgent need to identify suitable animal models for the preclinical evaluation of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines182.Thus, recombinant viral vectors are the second most common platform for COVID-19 vaccine development, with 4 candidates currently in clinical trials (Table 2), 38 under preclinical development5 and 3 (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, Ad26-S and VSV-S) selected for US Operation Warp Speed97 (Table 2).However, unlike nucleic acid-based or viral-vectored vaccines, recombinant S proteins in subunit vaccines could have an improper epitope conformation unless they are produced in mammalian cells136.Inactivated viral vaccines have few safety concerns, unlike their live attenuated counterparts, and they express a wide range of native viral antigens, including surface antigens with retained epitope conformations that can induce conformation-dependent antibody responses124,125.Although only a couple of viral-vectored vaccines have been approved for human use for the control of infections such as Ebola, this platform has been widely investigated and has a well-established track record for infectious diseases and cancer, given its genetic malleability, safety and ability to induce strong T cell responses without the need for an adjuvant95,96.Studies with inactivated SARS-CoV and respiratory syncytial virus vaccines have reported vaccine-related enhancement of disease, likely involving a T H 2 cell response and lung eosinophilia, which may be worsened in aged hosts56,74,129.As is the case for inactivated viral vaccines, use of unmodified alum as an adjuvant skews the immune response towards T H 2 cell-like responses56, which is undesirable for host defence against SARS-CoV-2 and may have a role in ADE of disease74,130.Inactivated viral vaccines Physically or chemically inactivated viruses have been used successfully in human vaccines against polio, hepatitis A and influenza121,122.Pfizer and BioNTech are also assessing an mRNAlipid nanoparticle vaccine encoding the S protein RBD (known as BNT162b1) in humans, who developed robust S protein-specific antibody and CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses following two repeated parenteral injections147,148.Human ACE2-expressing mice that are further humanized to express human HLA genes and/or to have human immune cells will be useful for studying human immune responses and immunodominant epitopes following vaccination and viral infection with SARS-CoV-2.For example, an mRNA vaccine for influenza virus induced long-term humoral immunity in young and aged mice149, and an mRNA vaccine for Zika virus induced both antibodies and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells in mice154.As of 31 July 2020, there were 27 vaccine candidates for COVID-19 in clinical evaluation and 139 vaccines in
